# Digital-Clock-Using-Proteus
my project involves building a clock and stopwatch device that combines the functionality of both timekeeping devices. The clock resets when it reaches 59 seconds, while the stopwatch allows the user to input a number and have the LED remain on for that duration of time, using the 74190 IC, a decade counter with a 4-bit binary coded decimal (BCD) output, which is known for its reliability, low power consumption, and ease of use. Overall, my project is a useful and versatile timekeeping device that combines the features of a clock and a stopwatch in a single device.
